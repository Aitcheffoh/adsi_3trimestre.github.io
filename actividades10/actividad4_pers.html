	<p>Somebody Told Me</p>
	<p>Breaking my back
Just to know your name
Seventeen tracks
And I've had it with this game
<br><br>
I'm breaking my back
Just to know your name
But heaven ain't close
In a place like this
<br><br>
Anything goes but don't blink
You might miss
<br><br>
Because heaven ain't close
In a place like this
I said heaven ain't close
In a place like this
<br><br>
Bring it back down
Bring it back down tonight
Never thought I'd let a rumor
Ruin my moonlight
<br><br>
Well, somebody told me you had a boyfriend
Who looked like a girlfriend
That I had in February of last year
It's not confidential, I've got potential
<br><br>
Ready? Let's roll
Onto something new
Taking its toll
Then I'm leaving without you
<br><br>
Because heaven ain't close
In a place like this
I said heaven ain't close
In a place like this
<br><br>
Bring it back down
Bring it back down tonight
Never thought I'd let a rumor
Ruin my moonlight
<br><br>
Well, somebody told me you had a boyfriend
Who looked like a girlfriend
That I had in February of last year
It's not confidential, I've got potential
A rushing, a rushing around
<br><br>
Pace yourself for me
I said maybe, baby, please
But I just don't know now
When all I want to do is try
<br><br>
But somebody told me you had a boyfriend
Who looked like a girlfriend
That I had in February of last year
It's not confidential, I've got potential
A rushing, a rushing around
<br><br>
Somebody told me you had a boyfriend
Who looked like a girlfriend
That I had in February of last year
It's not confidential, I've got potential
A rushing, a rushing around
<br><br>
Somebody told me you had a boyfriend
Who looked like a girlfriend
That I had in February of last year
It's not confidential, I've got potential
A rushing, a rushing around</p>
